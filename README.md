# Airplane Templates

This repo is a growing collection of examples of Airplane tasks, views, and workflows. Each directory has a detailed example of a common use case that we've seen. We hope that this helps you learn about Airplane and build tools faster.

To use a template, you can run `airplane init --template=<relative path to template directory>`.

For more details, visit the [Template Gallery](https://docs.airplane.dev/templates).
