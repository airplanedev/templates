# Template: Admin panel

## Next steps

- Navigate to the admin_panel directory: `cd ruby_task`
- If you plan on using this on a different database resource than the demo database, change the `demo_db` resource in `entrypoint.task.yaml` to the name of your own database resource
- Develop your template locally: `airplane dev`
- Deploy your tasks and view: `airplane deploy --yes`
- Visit the docs to learn more about how to build views: https://docs.airplane.dev/views/getting-started
