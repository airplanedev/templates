# Template: Python selenium example

Simple task that demonstrates how to load a website in Python using [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and Firefox.

To run locally:

1. Install Firefox, you can do so [here](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/).
2. Download `geckodriver` [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and place in your `PATH`. `geckodriver` is used by `selenium` to interface with Firefox.

## Next steps

- Navigate to the python_selenium_example directory: `cd python_selenium_example`
- Run your task locally: `airplane dev`
- Make any changes to the `selenium_example.py` script
- Deploy your task: `airplane deploy --yes`
